# TO-DO-APP
A simple to-do-app 
Using BootStrap 4 and simple Js

1. I will be add delete button to each li element.
2. Also, I'll add the toggle function to each li element.

---Issue you have to fix---
 When i add lot of lists then it doesn't have scroll functionality. I tried the overflow property but still it doesn't work. So fix this.
 Also you can modify the frontend part to beautify it. If you can add the card shadow effect to the card so that the card is easily visible throughout the webpage then 
 it's fine otherwise no issue. 



NEW ISSUE DETECTED ---19-may-2021---
    When i add the lists then when i click on backspace or delete button then it is not deleting. I have to press the remove button once the  the backspace and the remove button works. Fix this issue.

I have already added the overflow-y property on container but the scroll effect on li elements still not working. Fix this also.



----20 may-----
I have added the buttons to each lists.
Later I'll be add the delete functionality to each list buttons.
