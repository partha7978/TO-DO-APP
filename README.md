# TO-DO-APP
A simple to-do-app 
Using BootStrap 4 and simple Js

1. I will be add delete button to each li element.
2. Also, I'll add the toggle function to each li element.

---Issue you have to fix---
 When i add lot of lists then it doesn't have scroll functionality. I tried the overflow property but still it doesn't work. So fix this.
 Also you can modify the frontend part to beautify it. If you can add the card shadow effect to the card so that the card is easily visible throughout the webpage then 
 it's fine otherwise no issue.
